# Peer-to-peer Systems - Week 3



### 1. Which one of the following does NOT describe a peer-to-peer system?
- [x] One node serves as a dispatcher ensuring reliable point-to-point communication among the others.
- [ ] In a peer-to-peer software system, each computer can exchange data with any of the others in the system.
- [ ] The system is composed of a set of nodes all connected with each other.
- [ ] Each node can be both a consumer and a provider of resources and services that benefit the overall system.


### 2. What is the relationship between the blockchain and a peer-to-peer system?
- [ ] Since a peer-to-peer system relies on a central node to moderate data exchange among the other nodes, it is an excellent candidate for deploying blockchain technologies.
- [ ] The nodes in a peer-to-peer network need an intermediary – such as blockchain software – to regulate the flow of inter-nodal data.
- [x] Since the blockchain is a tool for ensuring integrity in a distributed system, it can serve this function in a peer-to-peer network.
- [ ] The blockchain allows a centralized system to behave like a peer-to-peer network by assuming the role of a dispatcher controlling node-to-node communications.


### 3. What is the relationship between the blockchain and a peer-to-peer system? 
- [x] Software developers sharing code directly with each other.
- [ ] Consumers purchasing groceries online from a grocery store.
- [ ] Job-seekers requesting their universities to send transcripts to prospective employers.
- [ ] Retirees using stock market earnings for their living expenses.


### 4. In order for individuals to trust making purchases through a peer-to-peer system (such as eBay), that system needs to provide assurance that it CANNOT be compromised by (choose ALL that apply). 
- [ ] A failure of the central dispatching node.
- [x] Malevolent participants
- [x] Technology failures
- [ ] A failure of the blockchain algorithm.


### 5. Ideally, one needs to know the number of nodes and their trustworthiness in order to maintain the integrity of a peer-to-peer system. If this is not possible, then: 
- [x] The blockchain is probably the best option for ensuring system integrity.
- [ ] No practical way exists to ensure system integrity; thus, the system will ultimately collapse
- [ ] System users (peers) must determine the best statistical estimate for the number of nodes in order to adopt the blockchain for system integrity.
- [ ] It will be impossible to attract participants unless a full inventory of peers (nodes) and the trustworthiness of each peer can be determined.


### 6. When we refer to blockchain as a data structure, we mean: 
- [ ] A diagram or map of the layout of nodes in a peer-to-peer network.
- [x] Data organized into units called blocks. 
- [ ] An inventory of nodes in a distributed network.
- [ ] A storage repository for objects of value, such as bitcoins.


### 7. When we refer to blockchain as an algorithm, we mean:
- [ ] The underlying operating system software for each individual computer associated with a distributed system’s nodes.
- [ ] The distributed software application that allows secure messages to be transmitted between a system’s nodes
- [x] The sequence of computer instructions that implement blockchain functionality.
- [ ] The academic study of secure multi-nodal, distributed systems.


### 8. When we refer to blockchain as a suite of technologies, we include the following (choose the BEST answer): 
- [ ] Software programming language(s) used, database format (relational vs. tabular), and inter-node messaging security.
- [ ] Node inventory control, peer-to-peer messaging protocols, risk assessment calculations (for individual nodes), and distributed data management protocols.
- [ ] Distributed network risk reduction, blockchain integrity enhancement, and peer-to-peer communications protocols.
- [x] Blockchain-data structure, blockchain-algorithm, cryptography, and security technologies.
