# Foundations of Blockchain and Digital Currencies


## 1. Which one of the following actions involving a digital camera is associated with the APPLICATION layer?
- [ ] Storing the image in JPEG format.
- [x] Selecting the zoom level when framing a photograph.
- [ ] Applying a file compression algorithm to increase storage capacity.
- [ ] When saving an image, inserting a timestamp into each image’s file name.


## 2. Which one of the following actions involving an airline reservation website is associated with the IMPLEMENTATION layer?
- [ ] Pre-ordering a meal.
- [ ] Specifying a point of origin, a destination, and preferred travel dates.
- [x] Holding a reservation for five minutes while the payment is processed.


## 3. The center node in a centralized cellular telephone system fails. What happens next (choose the BEST answer)?
- [ ] Everyone will still be able to communicate through adjacent-cell relay.
- [ ] Only people connected to cells (nodes) that are directly connected to that center node will be able to communicate.
- [x] Nobody will be able to communicate
- [ ] Only people connected to adjacent cells (nodes) will be able to communicate.


## 4. Why are distributed systems (such as the Internet) considered to be more reliable than non-distributed systems?
- [ ] The internet, as a distributed system, poses few security risks because a server (node) infected by malware can be quickly disconnected from the system with minimal effect on the other servers.
- [ ] If one internet server (node) fails, data can be rerouted through alternate pathways.
- [ ] All components are effectively coordinated by a central domain registry, which helps ensure a low risk of failure.
- [x] Distributed systems generally require less complex hardware and software to manage their operations, which means there are fewer components that can fail.


## 5. Which of the following is NOT a distributed system? 
- [x] An automobile’s electrical system.
- [ ] Online shopping with purchases delivered by mail.
- [ ] Air transportation in North America.
- [ ] The United States Postal Service (i.e. mail delivery services).


## 6. Which one of the following is a characteristic of a digital currency such as bitcoin? 
- [ ] It is backed by a fixed supply of gold.
- [ ] It is tied to the economy of the country that issues it.
- [ ] It was originally intended to be used for high-stakes transactions between corporate entities and national governments.
- [x] It is used to communicate value, albeit in a decentralized manner


## 7. Which type of currency system relies on intermediaries to carry out transactions?  
- [ ] Digital currencies.
- [x] National currencies.
- [ ] Cryptocurrencies.
- [ ] Blockchain-based currencies.


## 8. What is the fundamental reason for implementing a blockchain?
- [x] Ensure integrity in a distributed system.
- [ ] To provide better currency stability than traditional central banks.
- [ ] To limit banking activities to “legitimate” institutions by introducing computationally intensive digital “keys.”
- [ ] Provide an alternative means of conducting banking activities in the event of a financial crisis.


## 9. Suppose your local economy is experiencing double-digit inflation. How will the value of your bitcoin holdings change? 
- [ ] Under inflationary circumstances, bitcoin becomes very stable so the value of your holdings will not change much.
- [ ] Its value will change inversely proportionally to the rate of change of inflation.
- [x] It is not possible to determine precisely how bitcoin value will change because it is not tied to national or institutional banks.
- [ ] It will change in proportion to the rate of change of inflation (e.g. an increase in inflation yields greater bitcoin value).


## 10. Why is bitcoin so revolutionary? (Choose the BEST answer.) 
- [x] It allows monetary transactions to take place in a distributed, decentralized manner without needing to trust a central authority.
- [ ] It emerged from blockchain technology, which was invented to facilitate financial transactions on the internet
- [ ] It makes use of computer and internet technology in new and innovative ways.
- [ ] It serves as an alternative to traditional currency by revolutionizing trust in government-run central banks.
