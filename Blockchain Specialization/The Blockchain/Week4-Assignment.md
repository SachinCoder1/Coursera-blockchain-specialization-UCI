# Peer-graded Assignment: Currency Calculations - Week 4



Assignment Question :-
Step 1: Fill in the third column with today’s figures – how much would you get by purchasing $1,000 of each currency today (at the point in time when you complete this assignment). Then calculate how many DOLLARS you gained or lost in the fourth column. (Make sure you’re looking up the value of bitcoin cash rather than simply bitcoin.) Type “exchange rate” into Google for a converter. There are others on the web, as well.

Step 2: Now, answer the following questions, and allow someone in your class to provide feedback to your answers:
1. Overall, did you make or lose money?
2. Which of the currencies (including gold) maintained the most value over this time period?
3. In your opinion, would you consider “holding” blockchain cash over a period of, say, one to five years or would you try to spend it quickly?


Answer 2: 

1. We lose money.
2. The most profile is in the Indian Rupee.
3. I  will not hold the blockchain cash over a period of time because it has dropped very much and i would like to see it more before thinking to hold it.
